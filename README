Blowfish bindings for lua.

LICENSE:

This lib uses part of the code coming from the nettle library
which is lgpl'd. I think that means this must be LGPL'd as well.

Anyway, this lib is released under LGPL, which means
	You need to release the source if you make derivative work...
	basically if you use the source for anything, that thing must be
	released under LGPL

	If you use this ("bf = require 'blowfish'"), it is not derivative
	work, you're just making use of the library and that doesn't mean
	that code must be LGPL'd or GPL'd or free software or even open source.
	(If you're wondering "but I have to distribute sources for a person
	to be able to run lua scripts", google luac)

You SHOULD read the LGPL anyway, including that famous disclaimer.

The LGPL is available at 'LICENSE'.

BUILDING:

This is atm using lua5.1 library. It should* work with newer versions.
It expects lua's headers to be in a folder called "lua5.1".

There are two ways of building lua-blowfish.

1) make
	This is cool if you're on linux and don't really want to install
	to some common directory, just want to build the shared object.

	I wrote it in a linux only fashion, because I was using linux
	and I am really no make god, so I didn't want to spend a lot of
	time learning it.

2) luarocks
	LuaRocks should be able to compile this in every major OS, I am not
	sure, though. It worked on more than one linux distro and a Mac.

If you're having problems and you're using some UNIX based OS, then
ask for help. If you're using Windows, just die. Or give up (on win).

CONTRIBUTING:

I don't really care how you like to code, the only thing I do care is
TABS ARE TABS. Not spaces, tabs, \t, got it? Ok, :D

DOCUMENTATION:

There's an example in the examples folder and cool ldoc documentation in
the doc folder. Just open index.html and everything should be clear.
I tried my best to have cool documentation and I think that's the only
thing I didn't screw up. Well I hope I haven't.
